    <h3>Welcome to the Ruby Keymap Project</h3>

    <p>I am looking for co-contributors to round out the API and tests. If you have interest in helping please let me
      know. I think this is pretty cool, and it's a great way to learn more about Ruby and ActiveRecord itself.</p>

    <h3>Recent Updates</h3>

    <it>2012-11-03</it>
    <br/><cite>We now have support for Ruby hashes! Like
    the support for arrays (lists), the hash integration supports a vast
    subset of the Hash API as well as Enumerable. Unlike lists, as described
    below, performing an each operation will pull all the keys into memory.
    That should be a design consideration for users dealing with massive
    datasets.</cite>

    <it>2012-11-01</it>
    <br/><cite>This week enumerable-based list support is available and fully tested.
    This allows Ruby developers to access and iterate over their key-value
    store data the same way they perform map, collect, inject operations
    over Ruby arrays. And what's more, data is read incrementally so that
    you don't blow your address space when reducing or summarizing larger
    dataset sizes.</cite>

    <!--
    <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

    <pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout gh-pages
    </code></pre>

    <p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

    <h3>Designer Templates</h3>

    <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

    <h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

    <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
